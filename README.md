Websites like RateMyProfessor.com collect instructor reviews for student use. Aggregate scores from websites like these provide a quick assessment of courses at a glance; however, researchers have questioned whether or not these reviews are accurate representations of overall student sentiments. The main concern is that students may not have the time or resources to assess the overwhelming number of reviews. And so, the first goal of this project is to provide students with concise information about the information contained in these text-reviews. This will be accomplished by developing a predictive model of expected student performance based on the reviews from previous years. The second goal of the project is to provide instructors with insight into what factors may influence academic performance. This will be achieved through natural language processing techniques. Through this analysis, the intent is to provide both parties better tools to improve their overall academic experience.
